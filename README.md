Hello!

This is a simple project running fully in C++.

Its main objective is to get from point A to point B and display its position until it gets to the destination.

You can use the output or compile the main.cpp and run it using the argument 
("output" "file name" "algorithm")

Filename in this case would be RobotNav-test.txt

Algorithm can be one of these: 
  BFS
  DFS
  UCS
  GBFS
  BeamSearch
  AStar


Thank you for stopping by!
